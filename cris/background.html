            <h1>Why RNA?</h1><hr>
            <h2>Molecules to Medicine Mentality</h2>
                <p>
                    RNA, or <i>Ribonucleic Acid</i>, stands as a pivotal biomolecule crucial to life, with growing recognition of its potential as a therapeutic target. Originally viewed as a mere messenger molecule for shuttling genetic information from DNA to proteins, recent research has illuminated RNA's multifaceted roles. Beyond gene regulation and protein synthesis, RNA orchestrates critical functions in cell signaling and facilitates intricate intra- and intercellular interactions. This expanded role is underscored by the emergence of RNA-based drugs approved for clinical use and numerous candidates in clinical trials, transforming RNA from an "undruggable" target to a promising frontier in disease treatment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The "Molecules to Medicine" approach emphasizes translating fundamental biological insights into clinical applications. In RNA research, this mindset underscores the journey from understanding RNA structures and functions at a molecular level to harnessing this knowledge for therapeutic use. This holistic approach integrates interdisciplinary expertise, combining molecular biology, bioinformatics, and pharmaceutical sciences to innovate diagnostics, therapies, and personalized medicine strategies. In recent decades, RNA research has witnessed explosive growth fueled by technological advancements and interdisciplinary collaborations. This expansion encompasses the study of RNA structures, functions, interactions, and regulatory mechanisms across diverse biological contexts. The field's evolution has been propelled by innovative physical and chemical methodologies that enable precise characterization of RNA molecules, revealing intricate details crucial for understanding their roles in health and disease.
                </p>
            <h2>RNA Structures</h2>
                <p>
                    RNA molecules adopt intricate three-dimensional structures crucial for their diverse biological functions. Elucidation of such structures is pivotal, as it provides insights on their functional capabilities, such as catalysis, molecular recognition, and gene regulation. Despite strides in understanding RNA's complexity, unraveling its structural and interactive properties within living cells remains a formidable challenge. Characterizing RNA's secondary and tertiary structures proves particularly daunting due to the dynamic nature and complexity of RNAs in vivo. 
                </p>
            <h2>Physical Methods</h2>
                <p>
                    Physical methods like X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) have been instrumental in deciphering RNA's structural complexity at atomic resolution. For instance, X-ray crystallography involves crystallizing RNA molecules and bombarding them with X-rays to determine their atomic structure. NMR spectroscopy analyzes the magnetic properties of RNA atoms, providing insights into their spatial arrangement in solution. Cryo-EM captures high-resolution images of RNA molecules in their native states, offering structural details without the need for crystallization. Notably, all of these techniques remain limited by their respective technologies, never truly capturing the complexity of RNA <i>in vivo</i>.
                </p>
            <h2>Chemical Methods</h2>
                <p>
                    The advent of probing and next-generation sequencing-based techniques has revolutionized RNA research in cellular environments. These methods combine enzymatic and chemical treatments with high-throughput sequencing to capture detailed RNA data. Take for example, selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension (SHAPE), dimethyl sulfate (DMS) probing. SHAPE identifies flexible and structured regions within RNA molecules by reacting with accessible 2'-hydroxyl groups. DMS probing reveals RNA bases that are unpaired or in double-stranded regions. Though informative, they still fall short when it comes to directly identifying specific interactions whilst also often being limited in the scope of their application.
                </p>
            <h2>Crosslink-Ligate Principle</h2>
                <p>
                    The crosslink-ligate principle  is an approach that involves crosslinking spatially proximate RNA molecules with specific reagents to stabilize and directly capture their interactions. Subsequent ligation of crosslinked RNA fragments allows the reconstruction of RNA networks and structural motifs. By integrating crosslinking with high-throughput sequencing or mass spectrometry, researchers can comprehensively map RNA-protein and RNA-RNA interactions, unraveling the intricate networks that underpin cellular functions.
