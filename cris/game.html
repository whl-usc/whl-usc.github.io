            <h1>Welcome to DRUG@home: A Citizen Science Adventure in RNA Medicine</h1><hr />
            <h2>Unlock the Power of RNA to Shape the Future of Medicine</h2>
                <p>
                    <u>D</u>rugging <u>R</u>NA <u>U</u>sing <u>G</u>ames @ home is a cutting-edge online video game designed to empower players to directly contribute to solving biological and therapeutic puzzles. In this exciting game, you will:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Choose puzzles and justify your choices</li>
                    <li>Write research plans and model RNA structures</li>
                    <li>Predict splicing effects and design RNA-targeting ASOs (Antisense Oligonucleotides)</li>
                    <li>Help shape the future of RNA therapeutics</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Inspired by successful platforms like <strong>FoldIt</strong> and <strong>EteRNA</strong>, DRUG@home integrates tools like the <strong>IGV (Integrative Genomics Viewer)</strong> tool, the <strong>ViennaRNA RNA structure prediction engine</strong>, and the <strong>VARNA structure visualization tool</strong>, all of which can intake data from the current CRIS database.
                </p>
           <h2>Crowdsourcing RNA Structure-Function Analysis for Drug Design</h2>
                <p>
                    We’re taking the concept of <i>citizen science</i> to the next level. Building on the success of public engagement in designing protein and RNA structures, DRUG@home allows players to predict RNA structures, explore biological mechanisms, and even design novel therapeutics for diseases caused by RNA defects.
                <br /><br />
                    RNA are implicated in a wide range of diseases, from common conditions like <i>cancer</i> and <i>Alzheimer's</i> to rare genetic disorders. Through our platform, players can contribute to research that has the potential to advance RNA-targeting therapies for these conditions, especially for rare diseases where “N=1” clinical studies have already shown promising results. With <i>DRUG@home</i>, we are creating a platform that goes beyond education. Players, especially high school and college STEM students, as well as families and communities impacted by RNA diseases, will be able to contribute directly to drug development. By involving the public in <i>RNA-based therapeutics</i>, we’re pushing the boundaries of <i>citizen science</i> and enabling <i>citizen medicine</i>. Our goal is to democratize access to RNA research, extending it beyond well-funded research labs and big pharmaceutical companies to marginalized groups worldwide.
                </p>

            <h2>Explore Thousands of Genes and Molecular Phenotypes</h2>
                <p>
                    Our CRIS database includes over <strong>10,000 genes</strong>, each cataloged with detailed structural information and molecular phenotypes such as splicing effects. This extensive dataset provides a foundation for solving some of the most complex biological and therapeutic challenges.
                </p>
            <h2>Design RNA ASO Therapeutics</h2>
                <p>
                    Unlike traditional small molecules, <i>ASOs (Antisense Oligonucleotides)</i> can be designed, synthesized, and tested based on their RNA target sequences and structures. In the game, players will use crosslinking data and splicing measurements to build RNA structure models and design ASOs to target diseases. Top designs will serve as research tools and potential drug candidates for related diseases.
                </p>
            <div class="separator-line"></div>
            <h2>A Rewarding Journey of Research and Discovery</h2>
                <p>
                    DRUG@home isn’t just about playing—it’s about contributing to real-world science. Players will be rewarded for their designs through:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Scoring based on curated rules</li>
                    <li>Opportunities for designs to be tested in the lab</li>
                    <li>Inclusion as co-authors in scientific publications</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The game follows an iterative <i>“Select-Predict-Design-Compare-Test”</i> cycle, which helps players improve their design skills and accelerates research in RNA biology and medicine.
